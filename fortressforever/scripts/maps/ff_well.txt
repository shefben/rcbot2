CAPTURE THE FLAG

Fight your way through the enemy base and bring back the flag to you own.  The flag is located at the back of the base, high up overlooking the bridge. Open the water route using a detpack for a new route into the enemy base.

The capture point is located in your own base, in the chamber below your flag room.
