INVADE AND DEFEND

Objective: 

Blue team starts as the attacker.  Red team 
starts as the defender.
 
The attacking team must take control of the 
town by pushing through and capping the four 
Command Points sequentially.  The defending 
team simply tries to hold out as long as they 
can. Once the attackers succeed, teams swap, 
and play begins again.

Command Points are captured by taking the flag
from the previous point and carrying it to the
next. When a Command Point is secured, the flag
required to capture the next Command Point
appears on top of it. For example, the flag
needed to capture Command Point 3 will always
spawn at Command Point 2.
