// This file's original content has been refactored and moved.
// Core CBotFF method implementations are now in ff_bot/bot_ff_core.cpp
// CClassInterface implementations are in ff_bot/bot_ff_class_interface.cpp
// Class-specific logic (tasks, schedules, helpers) is in ff_bot/classes/ (e.g., bot_ff_scout.cpp)

#include "bot_ff.h" // Still need to include the header for CBotFF declaration linkage.
// Other necessary includes that might be required by specific build system configurations,
// though ideally, this file becomes very lean or even empty if linkage is handled via headers.
